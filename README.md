# swifty-loading
A custom load screen

**Downloading and Installing**
**1**. Go to my GitHub and download.
https://github.com/SWIFTDESIGNS/swifty-loading
**2**. Extract to your desktop then rename the folder from **swifty-loading-main** to **swifty-loading**
once doing that you can drag the folder to your resources and then we move on to adding your own background video and music.

**Making your music and background video work**
**1**.So now we need to open our folder and head over to the **HTML** folder when doing so you will be missing an mp4 and an mp3 file as I can not upload them with the script. So find an mp4 backing video you want and an mp3 of your choice then drag it into the **HTML** folder.
**2**. Now you need to rename the **mp3** to **music.mp3** then for the **mp4** rename it to **backvid.mp4**. Your HTML folder should look like so.
